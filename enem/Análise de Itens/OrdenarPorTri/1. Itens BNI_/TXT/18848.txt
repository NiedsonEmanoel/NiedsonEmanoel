The Power of Pictures
by Vickie An

In February, the group took a photography field trip
to Haitis La Visite national park. A student holds up a
lizard as her classmates snap away.

£s said that a picture is worth a thousand words.
Conservation photographer Robin Moore believes this.
He especially belisves that the stories photographs can
tell about the environment can inspire people to care for
the earth. “It doesn't matter what language you speak
or what culture you come from, because a photo can
speak to everyone,” Moore says.

Thats the idea behind Frame of Mind. Moore
cofounded the organization last year with environmental
educator Deanna Del Vecchio and fellow nature
Photographer Neil Ever Osbome. The group is on a
mission to help young people around the worid connect
with nature through photography workshops.

In August 2011, Frame of Mind hosted its very first
workshop with 20 youth joumalists in Jacmel, Haiti
The workshop was held in partnership with Conservation
International and Panos Caribbean. Each student was
given a digital camera to use for the week and was taught
how to use it. During the session, the kids leamed about
the local environment and how it relates to their lives.
