Letter to the Editor

Michael Gerson's Oct. 19 Tuesday Opinion column,
“The state laboratory of idiocracy strikes again” did not
highlight the disservice done to the Black community
or any other minority group affected by White history.
1 wonder about how this will manipulate the perceptions
of minoríties in the eyes of students. The misguided
stereotypes and assumptions perpetuated by these
curriculum restrictions wil likely prevent Black Americans
from expressing themselves safely.

It's plausible to assume that continued miseducation
over generations could create a sense of false comfort
for Black Americans. Without proper access to history,
minorities might begin to forget the oppression they
have faced and the injustices they are currentiy dealing
with. Lacking this vital historical education only serves
to continue the longstanding issue of misinformation in
modern generations.

The problems are only the start of the issues that
could begin to plague the American education system.
