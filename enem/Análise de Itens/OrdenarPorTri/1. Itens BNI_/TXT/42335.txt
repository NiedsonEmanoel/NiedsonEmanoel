QUESTÃO 02
ff You're Out There
fyou hear this message
jerever you stand
Em calling every woman
Calling every man

We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
Tre future started yesterday
And we're already late

We've been looking for a song to sing
Searched for a melody
Searched for someone to lead
We've been looking for the word to change
ffyou feel the same, we'll go on and say
Ifyou're out there
Sing along with me if you're out there
im dying To believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud if you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now...now...now [...]
We can destroy Hunger
We can conquer Hate
Put down the arms and raise your voice
Were jomning hands today |. |
