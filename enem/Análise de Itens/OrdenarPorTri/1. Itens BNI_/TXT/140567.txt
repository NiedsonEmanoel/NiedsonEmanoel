QUESTÃO 04

Asmyofficialbio reads, Iwas madein Cuba, assembled
in Spain, and imported to the United States — meaning my
mother, seven months pregnant, and the rest of my family
arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid, where | was bom.
Less than two months later, we emigrated once more and
settled in New York City, then eventually in Miami, where
I was raised and educated. Although technically we lived
in the United States, the Cuban community was culturally
insular in Miami during the 19705, bonded together by the
trauma of exile. What's more, it seemed that practically
everyone was Cuban: my teachers, my classmates, the
mechanic, the bus driver. | didn't grow up feeling different
or treated as a minority. The few kids who got picked on
in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny
last names like Dawson and O'Neil
