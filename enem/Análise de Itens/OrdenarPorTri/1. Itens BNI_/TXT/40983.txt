Vogue Magazine's Complicated Relationship with Diversity

Edward Enninful, the new editorin-chief of British Vogue, has a proven history of
addressing diversity that many hope wil be the start of an overhaul of the global Vogue brand.

In March, he responded sublimety when US President Donald Trump nominated Supreme
Court judge Neil Gorsuch, who allegediy does not care much about civil rights: Emninful styled a
shoot for his then employer, the New Yorkcbased W magazine, in which a range of ethnicaly
diverse models climb the stairs of an imaginary "Supreme Court”. In February, after Trump

ted the much-debated immigration ban, Enninful put together a vídeo showcasing the
various fashion celebrities who have immigrated into the US. Even before his first oficial day
in Vogue's Mayfair offices, Enninful had hired two English superstars of Jamaican descent in an
altempt to diversify the team. Model Naomi Campbell and make-up artist Pat McGrath both
share Enninful's aim of championing fashion as a force for social change.

One can only hope that Enninful's appointment is not a mere blip, but a move in the right
direction on a long road to diversity for the global brand.
