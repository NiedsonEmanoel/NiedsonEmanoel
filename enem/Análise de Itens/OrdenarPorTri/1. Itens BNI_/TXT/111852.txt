Questão 04

We are now a nation obsessed with the cult of
celebrity. Celebrities have replaced the classic notion
of the hero. But instead of being respected for talent,
“courage or intelligence, it is money, style and image the
deciding factors in what commands respect. Image is
everything. Their image is painstakingly constructed by a
multitude of different image consultants to carve out the
most profitable celebrity they can. Then society is right
behind them, believing in everything that celebrity believes
in. Companies know that people wil buy a product if a
celebrity has it too. tis as ifthe person buying the product
feels that they now have some kind of connection with
the celebrity and that some of their perceived happiness
will now be passed onto the consumer. So to look at it
one way, the cult of celebrity is really nothing more than
a sophisticated marketing scheme. Celebrities though
“cannot be blamed for all negative aspects of society. In
reality society is to blame. We are the people who seemed
to have lost the abilty to think for ourselves. | suppose
its easier to be told what to think, rather than challenging
what we are told. The reason we are swamped by celebrity
is because there is a demand for it.
