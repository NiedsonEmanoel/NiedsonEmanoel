How On-line Gamers are Solving Science's
Biggest Problems

On paper, gamers and scientists make a bizare
union. But in reality their two worlds aren't leagues apart:
both involve solving problems within a given set of rules.
Genetic analysis, for instance, is about finding sequences
and patterns among seemingly random clusters of data.
Frame the analysis as a pattem-spotting game that looks
like Candy Crush, and, while aligning pattems and scoring
points, players can also be hunting for mutations that
cause cancer, Alzheimer's disease or diabetes.

“Our brains are geared up to recognise pattems”,
says Erinma Ochu, a neuroscientist at the University
of Manchester, explaining why scientists are tuming to
gamers for help, “and we do it better than computers.
This is a new way of working for scientists, but as long
as they leam how to trust game developers to do what
they do best — make great games — then they can have
thousands of people from all around the worid working on
their data”.
