QUESTÃO 05 DDDOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

We walked on, the stranger walking with us.
Taylor Franklin Bankole. Our last names an instant
bond between us. We're both descended from men
who assumed African sumames back during the 19605.
His father and my grandfather had had their names
legally changed, and both had chosen Yoruba
replacement names.

“Most people chose Swahili names in the 605”,
Bankole told me. He wanted to be called Bankole
“My father had to do something different. AI! his life
he had to be different”

“1 don't know my grandfather's reasons”, | said
“His last name was Broome before he changed it,
and that was no loss'. But why he chose Olamina...?
Even my father didn't know. He made the change before
my father was bom, so my father was always Olamina,
and so were we
