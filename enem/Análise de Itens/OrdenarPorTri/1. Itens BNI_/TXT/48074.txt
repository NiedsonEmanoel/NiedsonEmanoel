QUESTÃO 02

One of the things that made an incredible impression
on me in the film was Frida's comfort in and celebration
of her own unique beauty. She didn't try to fit into
conventional ideas or images about womanhood or
what makes someone or something beautiful. Instead,
she fully inhabited her own unique gifs, not particularly
caring what other people thought. She was magnetic and
beautiful in her own right. She painted for years, not to be
a commercial success or to be discovered, but to express
her own inner pain, joy, family, love and culture. She
absolutely and resolutely was who she was. The trueness
of her own unique vision and her ability to stand firmly in
her own truth was what made her successful in the end.
