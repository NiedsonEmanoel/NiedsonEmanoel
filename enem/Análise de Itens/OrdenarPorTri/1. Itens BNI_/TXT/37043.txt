British Government to Recruit Teens as Next
Generation of Spies

In the 50 years since the first James Bond movie
created a lasting impression of a British secret agent,
a completely different character is about to emerge
Britain's intelligence agencies are to recruit their next
generation of cyber spies by hamessing the talents of the
“Xbox generation”

In an expansion of a pilot program, Foreign Secretary
Wiliam Hague announced Thursday that up to 100
18-year-olds wil be given the chance to train for a
career in Britain's secret services. The move to recruit
school leavers marks a break with the past, when agencies
mainly drew their staff from among university graduates.

“Young people are the key to our country's future
success, just as they were during the War”, Hague said.
“Today we are not at war, but | see evidence every day of
deliberate, organized attacks against intellectual property
and government networks in the United Kingdom.”

The new recruitment program, called the Single
Inteligence Account apprenticeship 'scheme will enable

students with suitable qualifications in science, technology
or engineering, to spend two years leaming about
communications, security and engineering through formal
education, technical training and work placements.
