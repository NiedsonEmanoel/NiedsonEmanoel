To the Editor: Re “Girf's Death by Gunshot Is Rejected as
Symbol" (news article, May 6)
| find it abhorrent that the people of Burkesvile, Ky,
are not wiling to leam a lesson from the tragic shooting
of a 2-year-old girl by her 5-year-old brother. | am not
judging their lifestyle of introducing guns to children at
a young age, but | do feel that its irresponsible not to
practice basic safety with anything potentialiy lethal
— guns, knives, fire and so on. How can anyone
justify leaving guns Iying around, unlocked and
possibly loaded, in a home with two young children?
| wish the family of the victim comfort during this difficult
time, but to dismiss this as a simple accident leaves open
the potential for many more such “accidents” to occur.
| hope this doesn't have to happen several more times for
legislators to realize that something needs to be changed
