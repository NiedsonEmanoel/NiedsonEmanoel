Study: Literary Criticism Is Still Overwhelmingly Male.
By Zach Schonfeid
Women writers are all over the best-seller lists, but
lterary criticism is stil predominantiy a male fla.

That's according to the latest numbers from the
volunteer organization VIDA: Women in the Literary Arts,
which works for gender and racial parity in the literary
world. This year's report covers prestigious publications
like The New York Review of Books, which published 227
male reviewers last year but only 54 female reviewers,
and The London Review of Books, which published 146
male crítics and 44 women during the same period. The
Paris Review “made great strides toward gender parity”
in 2013, the report notes, but then sld and published
substantially fewer women than men in 2014.

As The Guardian points out, those figures are
especially striking when you consider that women are
more avid readers than men in the UK., where some of
the biggest offenders are based.

The figures are not all disheartening. Major magazines
like The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Harper's all showed
increases in the number of women published in 2014.

That data are valuable (without VIDA, the figures
would likely go untalled), and the broader awareness
even more so. Top editors likely know gender disparity is.
an issue, but they're more likely to pay attention to it when
an organization like VIDA is paying attention to them.
