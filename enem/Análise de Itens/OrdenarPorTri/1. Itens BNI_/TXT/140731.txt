QUESTÃO 01
A Teen's View of Social Media

Instagram is made up of all photos and vídeos. There
is the home page that showcases the posts from people
youfollow, an explore tab which offers posts from accounts
all over the worid, and your own page, with a notification
tab to show who likes and comments on your posts
It has some downsides though. It is known to make
many people feel insecure or down about themselves
because the platform showcases the highlights of
everyone's lives, while rarely showing the negatives.
This can make one feel like their life is not going as well
as others, contributing to the growing rates of anxiety or
depression in many teens today. There is an underiying
desire for acceptance through the number of likes or
followers one has.
