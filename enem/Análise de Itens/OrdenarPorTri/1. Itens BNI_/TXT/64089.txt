As Furniture Burns Quicker,
Firefighters Reconsider Tactics

House fires have changed. The New York Fire
Department is rethinking its tactics for residential fires,
while trying to hold onto its culture of “aggressive interior
firefighting” — charging inside buming buildings as fast as
possible.

Plastic filings in sofas and mattresses bum much
fasterthan older filings like cotton, helping to transform the
behavior of house fires in the last few decades, firefighters
and engineers say. With more plastic in homes, residential
fires are now likely to use up all the oxygen in a room
before they consume all flammable materials.

“Years ago you could break a window and it took the
fire several minutes to develop — or tens of minutes”,
a fire battalion chief in Queens, George K. Healy, said.
“Now we're leaming when you vent that window or the
door, the fire is developing in, say, a minute”
