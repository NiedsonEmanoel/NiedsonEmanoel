Questão 04

What is itabout Serena that inspires such vitriol? sit
that she dominates in a sport that was once considered
to be for the upper crust at country clubs? One would
think that Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe had put that
idea to rest decades ago. Is it that she is considered
too aggressive on the court? John McEnroe and Boris
Becker seem to take the prize for that. Is it because
she wins too much? To hate someone merely because
he or she is great only speaks to one's own insecurity.
To attempt to and fault with someone because you
“cannot figure out how or why they win so often only
shows that you have already lost. Or is it that she is
unapologetically black? A HCarefreeBlackGirl who
speaks her mind, supports her people, and whose only

real opponent is herselt.
