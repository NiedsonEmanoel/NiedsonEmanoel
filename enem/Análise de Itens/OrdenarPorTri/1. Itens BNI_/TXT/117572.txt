Becoming
Back in the ancestral homeland of Michelle Obama,
black women were rareiy granted the honorifi Miss or
Mrs, but were addressed by their first name, or simply as
“gal or "auntie” or worse. This so openty demeaned them
that many black women, long after they had left the South,
refused to answer if called by their first name. A mother
and father in 19705 Texas named their newbom “Miss' so
that white people would have no choice butto address their
daughter by that tie. Black women were meant for the field
or the kitchen, or for use as they saw fit. They were, by
definition, not ladies. The very idea of a black woman as
firstlady ofthe land, well, that would have been unthinkable.
